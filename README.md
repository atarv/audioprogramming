# Audio programming repo

This repository contains my solutions to some of the exercises in Richard Boulanger's [The Audio Programming Book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book)

## Compiling propgrams

To compile programs of this repository, change to directory containing a
Makefile. Then run comman `make`. If everything goes allright you should get
an executable named after the directory you are in.
